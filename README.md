This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.5.

## Development server

## App logic

CSS Grid Responsive Layout implementation with expandable sections.

Any given grid cell has a button that opens up another, larger area that is also part of the grid. But this new larger grid cell is displayed:
- right below the cell that opened it, and
- full width.

All the displayed data is fetched from a local json file.
